\section{Frame Extraction using Optical Flow}
To ensure the selected frames are highly relevant to the task, this study utilised an optical flow approach. This method prioritises frames with significant motion, which aligns well with the nature of skateboard tricks. The core principle behind this study's frame extraction method is the utilisation of Farneback's algorithm \cite{farneback2003two}. This algorithm
