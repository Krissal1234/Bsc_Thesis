\section{Development Environment}

\section{Frame Extraction using Optical Flow}
To ensure the selected frames are highly relevant to the task, this study
utilised an optical flow approach. This method prioritises frames with
significant motion, which aligns well with the nature of skateboard tricks. The
core principle behind this study's frame extraction method is the utilisation of
Farneback's algorithm \cite{farneback2003two}. This algorithm

\section{Callbacks}
\subsection{Early Stopping}
This research employed an early stopping callback to reduce overfitting and save
computational resources. This method monitored the validation loss at every
epoch and halted training if improvement stopped after a predetermined patience
value. This study investigated a pateience of 10 epochs, based on the
observation that the models were unlikely to improve after 10 epochs, with no
validation loss advancements.

\subsection{Model Checkpoint}
The training process incroporated model checkpointing to save intermediate
models after every epoch, allowing a seamless resumption of training in case of
interruption
