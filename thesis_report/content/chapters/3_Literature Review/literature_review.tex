\subsection{Activity Recognition Techniques}
\subsection{AI Trick Classification}
Recent advancements in recognising human actions in videos have significantly
impacted various fields, ranging from the medical sector to surveillance
systems, \cite{3DhumanActionDetectionForHealthCareSystems},
\cite{HumanActivityRecognitionSecurityAndMonitoring}. Particularly noteworthy is
its application in developing an AI-based skateboard trick classifier, an area
that has seen limited research.

\paragraph{}
In this emergent field, leveraging activity recognition techniques from a video
has led to two primary methodologies among researchers. The first technique
involves utilising signals obtained from skateboard-mounted accelerometers or
signals artificially generated based on the findings of prior studies. These
signals are then fed into a study-dependent model for classification, as
outlined in \cite{skateboardClassificationTransferLearningPipelinesAccelermetry}
and \cite{skateboardTrickClassifierUsingAccelerometryAndML}. The second approach
employs computer vision techniques, leveraging video footage of skateboard
tricks to train and refine models for accurate trick identification, as depicted
by the studies \cite{skatePaper1} and \cite{SkateboardAIPaper}. 

\subsection{Data Collection}

%Just in case i need to add it to Data colleciton
% The assortment of data stands out as the foundation of this study, it lends
% significance to the results as the quality and quantity of data have a direct
% relation with the capacity of AI algorithms to learn and generalise effectively. 

\paragraph{}
The study \cite{skatePaper1} leverages a custom data set, comprising videos
capturing the execution of five distinct skateboard tricks, each attempted five
times. Each video spans a duration of two to three seconds, yielding a total of
750 images by extracting 30 frames per video. Notably, each skateboard manoeuvre
was recorded against a uniform white backdrop, maintaining a consistent distance
of 1.26 meters between the skateboarder and the camera. In this study, the
researchers applied data augmentation techniques to expand their initial data
set in order to reduce the potential for model over-fitting noted by
\cite{DietterichOverfittingAI}. This paper utilises three rotation augmentation
techniques: horizontal rotation, positive 90\textdegree rotation and negative
90\textdegree rotation. Consequently, they introduced an additional 2,250
images, achieving a total of 3,000 images in their data set.

\paragraph{}
On the other hand, Chen \cite{SkateboardAIPaper} compiled a comprehensive data
set by collecting videos from multiple platforms including YouTube, Twitter and
Instagram. Furthermore, the researcher trained the model using 15 fundamental
tricks commonly observed in competitive settings. They collected 50 videos per
trick, summing up to a total number of 750 videos. Of these, 45 videos per trick
were allocated for training, and 5 were reserved for validation.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
\paragraph{}
An AI model cannot rely solely on raw data to achieve a favourable accuracy.
Instead, it benefits from the utilisation of preprocessing techniques that
enhance features and guarantee that data is formatted consistently
\cite{DataPreprocessingForImageClassificationByCNN}.
