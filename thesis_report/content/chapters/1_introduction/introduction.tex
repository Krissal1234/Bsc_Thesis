Skateboarding dates back to the 1940s when handmade skateboards first appeared
\cite{SkateboardingEncyclobeadia}. It has since developed into a worldwide
phenomenon, with its popularity skyrocketing, after gaining recognition as an
official sport in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games \cite{SkatebaordingOlimpics}.
Skateboarding comprises the dynamic activities of riding a skateboard and
skilfully performing a repertoire of tricks, manifesting as a popular and
exhilarating “extreme sport”. 

This dynamic sport encompasses various disciplines and riding styles, each
offering unique challenges for skateboarders to explore. Two of the most
prominent styles are “vert” and “street.” Vert skateboarding revolves around
riding on specialised obstacles, namely, half-pipes and ramps, emphasising
aerial manoeuvres. Street skateboarding transpires in urban environments,
utilising various obstacles that can be found outdoors, including stairs, rails,
ledges, gaps or flat ground for skaters to showcase their creativity
\cite{skateStyles}.
