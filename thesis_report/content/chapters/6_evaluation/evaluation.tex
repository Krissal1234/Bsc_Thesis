\subsection{Choice of Optimiser}
%This might need to go in evaluation, and only mention it in the implementation
This study compared the results of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam \cite{adam_paper} as
optimisation algorithms during training. The results suggest that SGD may be
more effective at reducing overfitting compared to Adam.
This improvement is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:loss_graphs}, using the VGG-BiLSTM architecture.
While, Adam initially shows promise with good generalisation, it quickly
encounters a pitfall, where the validation loss begins to climb, indicating
overfitting. In contrast, the SGD-trained model exhibits a more stable
validation loss, likely due to its algorithmic stability and its capability to
achieve small generalisation errors as explained in the study by Hardt et al.
(2016) \cite{SGD_stability_paper}. The results observed with the VGG-BiLSTM
aligns with the insights discussed by Hardt et al. suggesting that
models trained using SGD are less vulnerable to overfitting.

\subsection{The Effect of Data Augmentation}
This research, also compared the effects of Augmenting data before feeding it
into the sequence models. Table .. showcases the results
